# annotate_brat_dictionary_lookup_snomed
This repository contains a script to use a .tsv of SNOMED as dictionary lookup of these terms. There is an option of removal of certain 'semantic tags'. The input would be a folder with .txt files, and the output would be these .txt files and their corresponding brat annotations .anns files


* output_sample: zip folder containing the output
